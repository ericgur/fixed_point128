Install CMake and add it to the path (install option).
One time:
1) Setup the build system by running setup.bat. This creates a VS solution in build\fixed_point128_gtest.sln

After code changes:
1) Build the test app via build.bat
2a) Run all the tests via test.bat
2b) Run only the failed tests with run_failed.bat
